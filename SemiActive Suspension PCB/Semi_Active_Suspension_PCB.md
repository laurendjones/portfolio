# Semi-Active SUspension PCB

Semi-Active Suspension PCB features a STM32 microcontroller which controls 4 solenoid drivers with overcurrent protection . This setup enables us to dynamically adjust the damping force of our car's suspensionâ€”a pivotal aspect of our off-road racing vehicle. I debugged a working PCB; the PCB drives four solenoid valves, communicates over CAN, and has software scalable PWM.
