# Radio Software & Architecture

This year we are designing a research & development project: wireless data communication. This system has two Xbee 3 Pro 900MHz modules. Below is the architecture for the system. I have successfully created an Xbee network. An STM32 forwards a packet to an xbee via UART and then receives this packet on the second Xbee. This data is read via serial and displays on a live web-server. I am currently writing the software for the web-server to display live data from the carâ€™s drive-critical sensors.
